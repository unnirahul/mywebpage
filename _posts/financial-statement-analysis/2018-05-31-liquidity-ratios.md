<h1>Liguidity Ratios</h1>  

### Ability of a company to meet its short term obligations

1.  Current ratio
    - **Current Assets/Current liabilities**
    - Measuers if the companies current assets are sufficient to meet its current assets.
    - CR > 2 is healthy (but company like amazon has negative cash conversion cycle which means that CA are converted to cash before CL are due)
3.  Quick ratio
    - Ignores inventory (since it isnt as liquid)
    - **(CA-Inventory)/CL**
4.  Cash ratio
    - Ignores accounts receivable as well, because it depends on when customer is willing to pay
    - **(Cash and cash equivalents)/CL**
