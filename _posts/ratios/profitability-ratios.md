## How well a company has used its balance sheet resources to generate profit 

1. Return on Equity (ROE)
    -  Net Income/Average Shareholders' equity(over 2 consecutive years)
    -  Used when there is one balance sheet item and one income statement item as a part of a ratio.  
    -  How much a company earns of every dollar of equity.  
2. Return on Assets (ROA)  
    -  Net Income \over Average total assets
    - How many cents of profit for 1 dollar of asset.  
3. Based on Income statement items  
    (How well a company is managing costs, hese maintaining its profitability.)  
    1. Gross profit margin  (How well the company has managed its direct costs in selling its goods and services) 
        - GP% = GP/Revenue  (Amazon = 33%, means that COGS is 2/3rds of Revenue)
        - GP = Revenue - COGS
    2. Operating profit margin  
        - OP% = OP/Revenue  
        - OP = EBIT  
    3. Pretax margin  
        - Earnings Before taxes / Revenue  
    4. Net profit marging  (Amazon = 0.53%, means that other expenses amount to almost all of the remaining 1/3rd of revenue)
        - Net income/Revenue
