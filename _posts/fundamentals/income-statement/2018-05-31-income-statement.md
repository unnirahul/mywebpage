# Income Statement or Profit & Loss statement
---

## **Net Income (Profit or Loss) = Revenues - Expenses**

<em>Everything is recorded on an accrual basis, meaning that transactions are recorded as and when the economin event occurs, and not when the cash from this event is received or payed by the company.</em>

### Expensing vs Capitalizing
1. Expense
    - If the benifits of use of resource result in same period as the use itself, then the use is catagorised as an expense
    - Amount used appears on that period's income statement
2. Capitalized
    - If the benifits of use of resource are expected to accrue in the future term periods when compared to when the resources are used, then the amount used is capitalized. (Amount used is shown as an asset on the balance sheet.)
    - Eg: PP&E, Purchased patents and trademarks
    - They are eventually charged as expense to the <em>""Income statement""</em> using two different processes
        + Ammortization (period)
            * Allocate asset's value to those future periods when its benifits are expected to be earned, typically over the asset's useful life. 
            * 5 years -> 1/5th charged as expense in each year
            * eg: Depreicitation
        + Imapirment (destruction, one-time)
            * Write dow the value of asset during the period when teh value destruction occurs
