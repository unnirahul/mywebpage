# Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)
informational tool to prioritise what you can do and what affect that work will have on the process.  
Prioritization of problems (cost, reducing downtime)

## Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) value
1.  Start small, eg in 1 plant or 1 line
2.  Continues improvement (productivity etc)
3.  Components 
    -   Quality (How many sellable goods vs how many total)
    -   Performance (cycle time vs designed)
    -   Availability (total uptime vs planned)
4.  Calculate Cost of Lost Production
5.  Q*P*A = OEE
6.  Cant understand How effecting bottom line?
    - How much 1 minute of downtime costs?
    - Reduced margin (due to reduced parts produced)
    - Cost of quality
7.  Pareto charts
    - top 2 downtime contributors
    - Different veiws  based on users
8. ROI
    - MES cost, vs downtime reduction profit percent
    - understand are we reducing downtime and also the cost of reducing reason code
## Real Time Cost-per-Unit

### Reporting using MES 

### Critera for selection MES
1. What solution for control system you already have?
    - Better to have MES from same vendor
2. Customer have any preference?
3. What are they lookig to get out of the system?
    - Only OEE system to track downtime, that filters ou more expensive solutions, that offer enegy monitorin, statistical process control etc
4. What is the system architecture
    - Stand alone facility? multiple all over the world?
    - some are easier to integrate multiple facilities
5. What ERP system and what is the cost to integret the MES with that
    - eg, if oracle based instead of sql based MES
6. look and feel of the system (graphics)
    - excel type?
    - Web2.0?
7. Business sytems already in play and how to get info from that into the MES?
    -  quality control system
    -  lab info management system 
8. Costs
    - Roadmap/ reqirements (what syste availble)
    - licensing
