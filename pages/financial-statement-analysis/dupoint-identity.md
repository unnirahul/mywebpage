Relates ROE to various financial rations

>> ## ROE = Net Income/Avge Shareholder's equity
>> ROE = (Net Income/Avge Shareholder's equity) * (Revenue/Revenue) * (Avg Total Assets/Avg Total Assets)
>> 
>> - Net Profit Marging = Net income/Revenue (Profitability ratio)
>> - Total Asset Turnover = Revenue/Avg Total Assets (Activity Ratio)
>> - Equity Multiplier = Avg Total Assets/ Avg Shareholders Equity => Measure of the companies solvency

> High equity multiplier = High level of debt and low equity

> ## ROE =ROE = (Net Income/Avge Shareholder's equity) * (Revenue/Revenue) * (Avg Total Assets/Avg Total Assets) 
>>## ROE = Net profit margin * Total Asset Turnover * Equity Multiplier

Amazon ROE = 4.94%

 Amazon's ROE has improved over the last four years, why is this? During this time, its net profit margin has increased, which tells us that Amazon is doing a better job of controlling its expenses, leading to higher profits. However, the efficiency has decreased as its total asset turnover has decreased over the last few years. Another reason for its higher ROE is that its equity multiplier has increased, which means it borrowed more capital than raising equity capital. Increasing borrowing is not necessarily good, as it increases the chance of a company not paying off the loans on time.
