# Cash flow from operating activities

## Methods
1. Direct method
    -   Cash inflows and outflows are directly reported
    -   Costly for companies to maintain
2. Indirect method 
    Adjustments to net income is based only on cash receipts and payments, because net income is calculated based on accrual and not on cash basis.
    
    -   Adjusting for items that affect net income but not cash. (these are shown in income statement but no cash payed or received for it)
        +   Depreciation and Ammortization, credit sales
    -   Adjusting for items that affect cash but not net income. (these are not show in the income statement until the inventory is sold but the cash payed to buy it is not shown on the income statement.)
        +   Raw material and supplies purchased with cash but not sold as yet.

## Flow
1. Net income ($0.06)  
    Adjustements (to eliminate the impact of these items from the company's cash balance)
2.  Non-operations-related adjustments to net income (Amazon $8.78)
    Non-cash expeditures + expenditures related to investing and financing activities  
    *   Depreciation and ammortization expenses (ADDED)
        -   Becases deducted when calculating profit but not actually paid to anyone, so net income understates the cash on hand
    *   Non cash based salaries, eg stock (ADDED)
        -   Recorded as expense in the inoome statemet but no cash payed, so net income understates the cash on hand
    *   Non-cash based operating expenses (ADDED)
        -   Which were deducted as expense from the income statement
    *   Non Operating expenses (ADDED)
    *   Non Operating income (Subtracted)
    *   Deferred income taxes (ADDED)
    *   Excess tax benifit from stock based compensation [DEDUCTED]
3.  Operations related Adjustments ($2.54)
    -   Increase in inventories (DEDUCTED)
        +   Tells us how much the company has spent on purchasing raw materials and supplies. This is not recorded (marked as expense) on the income statement untill the inventory is sold. So net income is overstated
    -   Decrease in inventories (ADDED)
        +   Since that is now cash
    -   Increase in accounts receivable (DEDUCTED)
        +   Revenu and net income overstates the cash on hand
        +   not recieved cash for some of the sales
    -   Increase in accounts payable (ADDED)
        +   Not paid some of the vedors, but the cost is subracted from revenues to calculate net income 
    -   Accrued expenses (ADDED)
        +   Since it has not been paid yet but deducted from net income
    -   Unearned revenues (ADDED)
        +   Payement recieved in advance for products and services, so reported on the income statement only when the company delivers the product
4. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activies
    - **Net Income + Non-operations-related adjustments + Operations related Adjustments**  
        > 0.06+8.78+2.54 = 11.92
